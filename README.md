Minecraft-like voxel engine using OpenGL. Major thanks to @StanislavPetrovV for guidance with this project.
Works very well on lower end hardware, with custom shaders, working clouds and fog, water transparency, world and chunk generation, camera system, interactive character, terrain generation, and textures.


How to Use: Download the project, and run the main.py file
Controls: WASD for traversal and mouse to move the camera
